A basic email bot for sending an mail using the smtplib module. 

Description:

SMTP Setup: Connects to the Gmail SMTP server on port 587, performs the necessary handshake, and starts TLS encryption.

Reading Password: Reads the email account password from a file named 'password.txt'.

Login: Uses the obtained email and password to log in to the Gmail account.

Email Content: Defines the email subject and reads the email body from a file named 'body.txt'.

Message Formatting: Constructs the email message with the specified subject and body.

Sending Email: Uses the SMTP server to send the email from the specified sender ('FROM') to the specified recipient ('TO').

Prints Success: Displays a success message if the email is sent successfully.

Guidelines:

Security: Avoid storing sensitive information like passwords in plain text files. Consider using more secure methods, such as environment variables or a configuration file with restricted access.

Credentials: Replace placeholder values ('ENTER YOUR EMAIL HERE', 'ENTER PASSWORD HERE', 'FROM', 'TO') with your actual email address, password, sender, and recipient information.

File Handling: Ensure that 'password.txt' and 'body.txt' exist and contain the correct information.

Error Handling: Implement error-handling mechanisms to manage potential issues during the SMTP connection, login, and email sending process.

Secure Access: If using this script for a production environment, consider enabling two-factor authentication and generating an application-specific password for enhanced security.
