Simple Amazon web scraper using BeautifulSoup in Python.

This Python script uses BeautifulSoup and requests to create a simple web scraper for Amazon's best-selling electronics. 

The script sends an HTTP request to the provided Amazon URL, extracts relevant product details such as title and price, 
and stores them in a list of dictionaries. 

Finally, the script saves the gathered data to a JSON file named 'amazon_top_selling.json'. 
Adjustments may be necessary if Amazon's HTML structure changes.

First, make sure to install the required libraries:

pip install requests beautifulsoup4
